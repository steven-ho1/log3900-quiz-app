## Description

Trivia Theater is a web application where users can compete with each other in quiz games as well as manage quizzes.

This app was originally developed as part of the second integrative project [LOG2990](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/projet-de-logiciel-dapplication-web) at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

During the third integrative project [LOG3900](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/projet-devolution-dun-logiciel), it was further enhanced with additional features and a desktop app using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) was made.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management
3. Set up a MongoDB cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
4. Set up a Redis instance on [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/) for caching
5. Have an email account ready for configuring the email transporter

### Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-ho1/log3900-quiz-app
cd log3900-quiz-app
```

#### 2. Set up the web client

-   Navigate to the client-web folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd client-web
npm ci
```

#### 3. Set up the server

-   Navigate to the server folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm ci
```

-   Create a .env file with the following environment variables (consult the .env.example file for a template):

```env
# Secret key used for JWT or token-based authentication
TOKEN_SECRET=<your_token_secret_here>

# Redis configuration
REDIS_PASSWORD=<your_redis_password_here>
REDIS_HOST=<your_redis_host_here>
REDIS_PORT=<your_redis_port_here>

# Email configuration for sending emails
TRANSPORTER_EMAIL=<your_email_here>              # Email address used by the email transporter
TRANSPORTER_PASSWORD=<your_email_password_here>  # Password for the email address (or app-specific password)

# MongoDB connection URL
MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_url_here>
```

## Usage

-   To start the web client:

```bash
cd client-web
npm start
```

-   To start the server:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Once both the client and server are running locally, you can navigate to the web client in your browser (typically http://localhost:4200 for an Angular app).
